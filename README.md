# Vehicle Telemetry Analytics Project ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

## Overview
Simulated real-time vehicle telemetry data using Python. Data includes GPS, speed, fuel levels, and engine temperature across 3 fleet vehicles. Intended for fleet optimization and safety analysis.

## Dataset Columns
- `vehicle_id`
- `timestamp`
- `speed_kph`
- `fuel_level`
- `latitude` & `longitude`
- `engine_temp`

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Tableau Public (or Looker Studio for dashboarding)
- GitHub for code & dataset sharing

## Next Steps
- Create KPI dashboards
- Plot driver routes on geo-maps
- Build predictive alerts for high engine temperatures and fuel drops

## Try It
Clone this repo, run `simulate_vehicle.py`, and explore `vehicle_telemetry.csv`.
